    "Procedure-Based Questions:\n",
    "Definition: These questions require a detailed, step-by-step guide or process as an answer. They are focused on how to accomplish a specific task or achieve a particular outcome.\n",
    "Key Indicators: Look for questions that ask \"How to,\" \"What are the steps,\" or \"What should I do to.\"\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\"How can a woman with no financial support find a safe place to live?\"\n",
    "\"I want to buy a house. How much money can I withdraw from my PF?\"\n",
    "\"How do I get support if I lost my job and need money?\"\n",

    "Definition: These questions can be directly answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No,\" potentially followed by a succinct explanation. They typically inquire about the possibility, availability, or existence of something.\n",
    "Key Indicators: Questions that can be directly responded to with a binary answer.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\"Can women who left home due to violence get shelter?\"\n",
    "\"Is there support for women who have been trafficked?\"\n",
    "\"Are children allowed in shelters for women in difficulty?\"\n",
    "Informative Paragraph Questions:\n",
    "Definition: These questions demand an answer in the form of a comprehensive, informative paragraph. They generally request explanations, definitions, or detailed information about a specific subject.\n",
    "Key Indicators: Questions that ask \"What,\" \"Which,\" or \"Who\" that seek detailed information or explanation, but not in a step-by-step format.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\"What aid is available for women affected by HIV without support?\"\n",
