Details
The aims and objectives of the Inter-State Border Areas Development Programme ISBADP are to provide facilities for the socioeconomic development of the people living along the Inter-State boundary with Assam. Projects taken up under this program are to ensure sustainability and provide value addition to any given product. As far as possible, a cluster approach is encouraged.
ISBADP covers the villages within 0-10 km crow fly distance from the Inter-State boundary with Assam. Those villages located 0-5 km to the Inter-State boundary get first priority.
ISBADP funds are ordinarily used to bridge critical gaps and meet the immediate needs of the people residing near the Inter-State boundary. Planning and implementation of ISBADP schemes is done on a participatory and decentralized basis through the Deputy Commissioners/ Line Departments/ Village Councils.
The implementation of the ISBADP is taken up through the concerned Deputy Commissioners who hold regular meetings with line departments of their respective districts such as Power, Rural Development, Roads & Buildings, Water Supply, Social Welfare, Public Distribution, Civil Supplies, etc. in order to ensure the implementation of the ISBADP schemes in the identified Inter-State border villages.
