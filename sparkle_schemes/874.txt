Details
The Shravan Kumar Shramik Parivar Tirth Yatra Yojana (SKSPTYY) is a commendable initiative launched by the Uttar Pradesh government in 2022. Recognizing the significant contribution of construction workers to the state's infrastructure, the scheme aims to ease their financial burden and offer them a chance to experience holy pilgrimages. By providing a one-time grant, the SKSPTYY empowers registered construction worker families to embark on religious journeys. This financial support proves invaluable, allowing these families to experience the spiritual significance of pilgrimages, a tradition often cherished in India.
