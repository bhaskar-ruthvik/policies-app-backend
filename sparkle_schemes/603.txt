Details
The Interest Subsidy Eligibility Certificate (ISEC) Scheme is an essential mechanism for funding the Khadi program undertaken by Khadi institutions. It was introduced to mobilize funds from banking institutions to fill the gap between the actual fund requirements and the availability of funds from budgetary sources.
Under the ISEC Scheme, credit at a concessional rate of interest of 4% per annum for working capital, is made available as per the requirement of the institutions. The difference between the actual lending rate and the Central Government pays 4% through KVIC to the lending banks.
