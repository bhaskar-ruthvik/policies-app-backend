Details
The Special Projects component of PMKVY envisages the creation of a platform that will facilitate trainings in special areas and/or premises of Government bodies, corporates or industry bodies, and training in special job roles, not defined under the available Qualification Packs (QPs)/National Occupational Standards (NOS). Special Projects require some deviation from the short-term training guidelines under PMKVY. A proposing stakeholder can be institutions of Central or State Government(s), an autonomous body/statutory body or any other equivalent body or a corporate that wants to provide training to candidates.

The objective of Special Projects under  PMKVY 3.0 (2020-21) is to undertake project-based skilling interventions, primarily to meet the skilling needs of marginalised or vulnerable groups (to mean hereafter such as Scheduled Castes and Tribes, transgender, Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), women, economically backward people, any other category which identifies as marginalised/vulnerable and is recognised by the Government of India and State Government(s) and those from difficult/remote geographies, hard to reach areas (such as Left Wing Extremist (LWE) areas, aspirational districts, J&K, Ladakh, North East states, Island territories), which may not meet all the parameters as laid down in the guidelines of Short-Term Training (STT) of PMKVY 3.0 due to special circumstances

Special Projects also envisages to cover short- term skilling initiatives undertaken by reputed industry bodies offering captive placement opportunities; projects with innovative strategies; projects offering local livelihood through creative market linked entrepreneurship, and/or projects assuring international placements

By its very intent, the projects falling under the Special Projects of PMKVY 3.0 are required to be dynamic in approach and need to go beyond the routine short-term skilling to enhance the all-round competency and adeptness of the marginalised sections of the country

The targets under Special Projects will constitute 12% in Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) component of the total allocated targets under STT of PMKVY 3.0. Such projects will be approved by PMKVY 3.0 Executive CommitteeDuring PMKVY 2.0, states were also permitted to utilise 15% of their targets towards Special Projects. Similarly, in PMKVY 3.0, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) permits States to implement 15% of their STT targets as per these Special Project guidelines, within the state STT budget. Such projects will be approved at the State level by State Empowered Committee
