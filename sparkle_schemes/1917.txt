Details
The Green House Scheme under the Agriculture Department of Rajasthan Provides the benefit of subsidy on greenhouses and earn more income by cultivating horticultural crops like vegetables, flowers, fruits, etc. by controlling the ago-climatic factors, temperature, humidity, and sunlight.
A greenhouse is a hut-like structure made of glass or polythene. Plants are grown inside it by controlling the environment. Where certain types of crops cannot be grown in the open due to extreme cold, these crops can be easily grown by using greenhouses. In case production of crops is not possible due to excessive heat, crops can be grown in greenhouses. In this way, it becomes easier for farmers to grow crops in any season through greenhouses. Greenhouses are mostly used for the cultivation of fruits, flowers, and vegetables. Through this, good production can be achieved especially in vegetable farming.
