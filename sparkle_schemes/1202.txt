Details
The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS/Rashtriya Krishi Bima Yojana) has been under implementation in  Gujarat State since its introduction by the Govt. of India in the Rabi/Summer 1999-2000 season. The main aim of the scheme is to stabilize farmersâ€™ income, particularly in disaster years by providing insurance coverage and to provide financial support to the farmers in the event of failure of any of the notified crops as a result of natural calamities, pests, and diseases.
A total of 26 crops are covered under the scheme as mentioned below:
1. Kharif Crops: Paddy, Bajra, Maize, Ragi, Sorghum, Tur (Arhar), Green Gram. Black Gram, Math, Groundnut, Sesamum, Castor, Cotton and Banana.
2. Rabi- Summer Crops: Irrigated Wheat, Un- Irrigated Wheat, Gram, Rape seed/Mustard, Summer Bajra, Summer Groundnut, Potato, Onion, Garlic, Cumin, Fennel, and Isabgul.
Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd. (AIC) is an implementing agency for NAIS. AIC collects premiums, & calculates, and sanctions the applicable claims, receives the claims share from the concerned Government, and settles the claims through nodal banks.
            The scheme is implemented on an area approach. Taluka is the unit of insurance in the state. The claims under the scheme are calculated on the basis of a reduction in the yield per hectare for that year as compared to the threshold yield based on the average yield per hectare of the last five/three years. The yield per hectare is estimated on the basis of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) being conducted by the Agriculture Department of State Government.
