Details
The Agriculture Department of the Rajasthan government implemented the Plastic Tunnel (Lo-Tunnel) scheme, providing subsidies to farmers. A low plastic tunnel is a protected structure created by covering each crop bed with plastic sheeting at a low height after planting. It is made to protect crops from damage caused by low temperatures. This technique is very useful for off-season cultivation of vegetables in the plains of North India where the night temperature remains below 8 degrees Celsius for about 40 to 60 days during the winter season. This technique allows off-season vegetable cultivation. Vegetable seedlings are prepared using the plastic tray technique specifically in December and January.

Important points
The low tunnel can be constructed only after administrative approval is issued by the Horticulture Department.
Verification can be done by the constituted committee.
The payment of the grant amount will be transferred directly to the farmer's bank account.

Benefits
50 percent subsidy is available for a maximum of 1000 square meters.
Small/marginal category farmers are given a 75 percent subsidy for a maximum of 4000 square meters.
