Details
A  National Mission for Financial Inclusion (NMFI), namely, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) was launched across the Country  in August, 2014 by the Prime Minister with the idea to ensure that citizens envisage their financial activities. PMJDY provides universal banking services for every unbanked household, based on the guiding principles of banking the unbanked, securing the unsecured, funding the unfunded and serving unserved and underserved areas. In order to give impetus to financial inclusion initiatives of the Government, PMJDY scheme was extended beyond 14.08.2018 with the focus on opening of accounts shifting from “every household” to “every unbanked adult”. 
The scheme has been made more attractive with upward revision in 
(i)   OD limit from Rs. 5,000/- to Rs. 10,000/- and 
(ii)  Accidental  insurance cover on RuPay card holders from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.2 lakhs. 
PMJDY has been successful in increasing banking penetration and promoting financial inclusion across the country. The scheme has ensured access to various financial services like availability of basic savings bank account, access to need based credit, remittances facility, insurance and pension to the excluded sections i.e. weaker sections & low-income groups.
