These programs may include training in activities such as cooking, cleaning, and personal care.

Skill development oriented towards employability: The DDRS provides financial assistance to voluntary organizations for skill development programs that help persons with disabilities to find employment. These programs may include training in computer skills, office skills, and trade skills.
Training and awareness generation: The DDRS provides financial assistance to voluntary organizations for training programs for staff and caregivers of persons with disabilities. These programs help to build capacity and raise awareness about disability issues.
Construction and upgradation of infrastructure facilities for persons with disabilities: The DDRS provides financial assistance to voluntary organizations for the construction and upgradation of infrastructure facilities for persons with disabilities. This may include ramps, accessible toilets, and specialized equipment.
In addition to these direct benefits, the DDRS also helps to promote the empowerment of persons with disabilities by supporting voluntary organizations that work to advocate for their rights
