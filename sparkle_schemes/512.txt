Details
On 4th July 2018, the Government of India approved clubbing eight schemes under the Umbrella Scheme “Relief and Rehabilitation of 
Migrants and Repatriates”. Out of the 8 schemes, the scheme "Relief and Rehabilitation Assistance to Sri Lankan Refugees in the Refugee Camps" is implemented by the Freedom Fighters & Rehabilitation Division of the Department of Home, Ministry of Home Affairs.
The scheme provides relief materials, which among other things include Feeding Charges, Subsidized Rice, Clothing Materials, Utensils, Transportation Charges (on arrival), Porterage and Transport (on repatriation), Cash Doles, Infrastructure Facilities (at the camps), Electricity and Drinking Water, Vehicles and Petrol to the Sri Lankan Refugees. 
The entire expenditure is incurred by the State Government and is subsequently reimbursed by GoI. GoI's approach is to grant relief on humanitarian grounds with the ultimate objective of repatriating them back to Sri Lanka. Relief is given pending such repatriation. An amount of ₹ 1,226 crore (approximately) has been spent by GoI for providing relief and accommodation to these refugees during the period between July 1983 to March 2022.
