Details
The aim of the "Popularisation of Fishery Machinery/ Equipments/ Implements” for Intensive Aquaculture in Odisha for the Financial Year 2021-22" scheme is to provide subsidy support to farmers/ fishers who will procure the above implements during 2021-22 through State Plan Scheme “Popularization of Fishery Machinery / Equipments / Implements”.  Implements like Aerators, Air Blowers with aero-tubes, bio-security nets, and fishing nets are an integral part of enhancing aquaculture production.
The objective of the scheme are:-
To sustainably increase the productivity and production of fish and shrimp. 
To maximize the profits of farmers by preventing disease outbreaks, stabilizing the biotic factors, quick turn-around time between two crops, etc. 
SCHEME SUBSIDY : 
The total outlay under the program is ₹10,00,00,000. 

Benefits
Access to Modern Equipment: The initiative may provide support for the adoption of modern and efficient fishery machinery, equipment, and implements. This can enhance the productivity and efficiency of aquaculture operations by reducing labor-intensive processes and improving overall production output.
Improved Productivity: The availability of advanced fishery machinery and equipment can lead to increased productivity in aquaculture. Mechanized processes, such as feeding, harvesting, and pond management, can be more effectively carried out, resulting in higher production yields and profitability for fish farmers.
Cost Reduction: By popularizing and providing access to fishery machinery and equipment, the initiative may aim to reduce the overall cost of production for fish farmers. Mechanization can help optimize resource utilization, reduce manual labor costs, and improve operational efficiency, resulting in potential cost savings.
Enhanced Efficiency and Quality: The use of modern fishery machinery and equipment can improve efficiency and ensure consistent quality in aquaculture operations. Automated processes can minimize human error and standardize production procedures, leading to better product quality and market competitiveness.
Technology Transfer and Knowledge Sharing: The initiative may include capacity-building programs and training sessions to educate fish farmers about the use and maintenance of fishery machinery and equipment. This promotes technology transfer and knowledge sharing, enabling farmers to make effective use of the provided resources and optimize their aquaculture practices.
