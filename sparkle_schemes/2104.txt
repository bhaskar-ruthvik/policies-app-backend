Details
In Kerala, a good number of women will have to undergo career breaks due to family commitments and as the gap widens, they will have limited opportunities for re-entry in Science.  In order to overcome this situation and to facilitate the re-entry of women having career breaks to Science research, the Kerala State Council of Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE) launched the “Back-to-Lab Research Fellowship Programme” in 2010. The Scheme aims to support Women Research Scholars having career breaks, to come back to research and complete the Ph.D programme. The fellowship is provided normally for a period of 3 years. The scheme is open to unemployed women of Kerala origin qualified with a post-graduate degree in Basic or Applied Science or Professional Courses.
Necessary conditions as per the scheme:
There should be a Scientist Mentor (preferably a Research guide) who is a regular faculty/staff of the institution under whose guidance the woman scientist should carry out the work. The Scientist Mentor should have at least 5 or more years of service left in the Institution before retirement. The Scientist Mentor should constantly monitor the progress of the project, facilitate smooth implementation of the programme and ensure timely submission of financial utilization certificates by the institute to KSCSTE.
In case the Research Fellow submits the Thesis before the scheduled tenure of the fellowship, the Thesis Submission Certificate and other completion documents should be submitted to KSCSTE within one month so as to enable termination of the Fellowship.
Research fellows availing financial assistance/stipend from other State/Central funding agencies or other sources will not be simultaneously eligible for the KSCSTE Back-to-Lab Research Fellowship. The Research Fellow should furnish an undertaking to the effect that she is not availing financial assistance/stipend from any other source simultaneously.
The implementing Institute should provide full infrastructural facilities such as a laboratory, computer, library, communication, accommodation, water, electricity, etc. for smooth implementation of the project.
The unutilized portion of the grant (along with the interest accrued) at the end of the project period should be refunded to Council by DD in favour of Member Secretary, KSCSTE.
Scientists who publish technical/ scientific papers based on the research work done under the project should acknowledge the assistance received from KSCSTE.
The Research Fellow should not enter into collaboration with a foreign party (individual/ industry) without prior approval of the Council.
