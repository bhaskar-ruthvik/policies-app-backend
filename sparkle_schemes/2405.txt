Details
The scheme "Nirman Shramik Avm Unke Aashrit Bacchon Dwara Bhartiya Rajasthan Prashasnik Seva Hetu Aayojit Pratibhabhik Yojana" initiated by the Labor Department of Rajasthan aims to foster the integration of children of registered beneficiaries engaged in construction and other related works into the mainstream of development. Through this program, the government seeks to provide opportunities for the children of laborers and workers involved in construction activities to access education and skill development, thereby enhancing their prospects for a better future.

By facilitating the participation of these children in educational and skill-building programs, the scheme endeavors to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty prevalent among families engaged in manual labor. By empowering the youth with education and skills, the government aims to equip them with the necessary tools to secure gainful employment opportunities and contribute meaningfully to the socio-economic development of Rajasthan. Through this holistic approach, the scheme not only addresses immediate educational needs but also endeavors to create a pathway for long-term socio-economic upliftment and empowerment of families involved in the construction sector in the state.
