Details
The Mid Day Meals Scheme (MDM) is a welfare program introduced by the government to address the issues of hunger, malnutrition, and low school attendance among children. The scheme aims to provide free and nutritious meals to school children across the country. Under this initiative, a hot cooked meal is served to children in primary and upper primary schools.

The primary objectives of the Mid Day Meals Scheme are twofold. Firstly, it seeks to improve the nutritional status of children, ensuring they receive a balanced diet and essential nutrients necessary for their growth and development. Secondly, it aims to increase school attendance and retention rates by removing the barrier of hunger and incentivizing parents to send their children to school.
