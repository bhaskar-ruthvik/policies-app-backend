Details
In recognition of the critical role that child nutrition plays in overall development, the Government of Uttarakhand, through its Department of Women Empowerment and Child Development, has launched the "Mukhyamantri Aanchal Amrit Yojana." This social security scheme specifically targets the age group of 3 to 6 years, aiming to reduce malnutrition rates within this demographic. The program achieves this objective by providing access to vitamin-enriched food. This targeted intervention ensures a consistent intake of essential nutrients during a crucial growth period.  By addressing these dietary deficiencies, the "Mukhyamantri Aanchal Amrit Yojana" fosters not only improved overall health and well-being in children but also lays the groundwork for stronger cognitive development, ultimately shaping a brighter future for the state's youngest citizens.
