Details
There are a few chairs/professorships available in the country instituted by various ministries/departments/ academies with public funds. Considering the limited number of such opportunities, the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) has been catering to one such scheme - National Science Chair: Scientific Excellence & Science Leadership. The main aim of the scheme is to recognize active eminent senior resident Indian superannuated scientists for their outstanding contributions both nationally and internationally, in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM), and Medicine, to promote excellence and growth in R&D.
Mode-1: Scientific Excellence:
The performing senior scientists who have made outstanding contributions to research, as evidenced by S&T output indicators (i.e. publications, patents, technology transfer, software development or an impact on policy) and wish to continue their work in R&D will be recognized through this mode. SERB recognizes the need for utilizing the expertise of exceptionally meritorious senior scientists. Non-utilization of their expertise, in one sense, is a national loss and age should not be the criterion for performing scientists.
Objective:
To extend continuance of support for excellence in R&D activities of eminent senior superannuated scientists who are passionate in research as evidenced by the S&T output.
Advisory Committee:
A committee referred to as the National Science Chair Advisory Committee (NSCAC) has been constituted to oversee the development of the Chairs, make recommendations for the selection of the awardees, review their progress /extension, undertake assigned activities to ensure promotion, relevance, and quality of R&D, as well as to meet the goal of the awards.
Number of Positions:
The maximum number of positions is restricted to thirty (30).
Tenure and Commencement:
The award will be given initially for a period of 3 years and is extendable for a maximum of another two years, subject to the recommendations of the NSCAC.
Selected Chairs will have to join within a period of six months from the date of issue of the offer letter.

Benefits
An amount of ₹1.5 lakhs per month will be given to the awardee as a fellowship.
The Research Grant in this case will be ₹25 lakhs per annum.
For overhead expenses, ₹1.0 lakh per annum will be given to the host institution.
Note: The grant shall be used for manpower, equipment, travel (including international), contingency, etc. It needs to be utilized as per the norms of the Host Institute. Items purchased out of the contingency grant will be the property of the Host Institute after the completion of tenure. However, in certain listed items, their retention by the awardee will be decided in accordance with the existing government rules and regulations on the subject.
