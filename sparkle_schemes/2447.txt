Details
The Jyotiba Phule Shramik Kanyadan Yojana (JPSKPY) stands as a beacon of support for registered workers in Uttar Pradesh. Recognizing the financial strain that a daughter's wedding can cause, the government has established this scheme to provide much-needed assistance.  JPSKPY aims to empower these workers by easing their financial burden and promoting the social well-being of their families. This initiative fosters a sense of security and dignity among workers, knowing that the government is invested in the well-being of their families.  Furthermore, JPSKPY promotes gender equality by ensuring that financial limitations don't hinder a daughter's right to a proper wedding ceremony.  Ultimately, the Jyotiba Phule Shramik Kanyadan Yojana serves a dual purpose: it strengthens the social fabric of worker families and demonstrates the government's commitment to social progress in Uttar Pradesh.
