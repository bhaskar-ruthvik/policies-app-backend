Step 1: Initiation by the Extension Officer
The Extension Officers of the Coffee Board will motivate a group of tribal growers in each of the localities/villages to raise a coffee nursery on a community basis. This caters to the requirement of seedlings for annual expansion and consolidation programs.
Step 2: Location and Seedling Selection
The groups themselves decide on the nursery's location and the number of seedlings to be raised. This decision is made in consultation with the Extension Officer of the Coffee Board, considering factors like water availability and other essential resources required for a healthy nursery.
Step 3: Group Responsibilities
The group takes the responsibility of motivating their members to participate in raising the nursery and distributing the seedlings among the members.
Step 4: Cost Estimation and Control
The concerned Extension Officer estimates the cost involved in raising the group nurseries. It is ensured that the cost of raising each healthy coffee seedling does not exceed ₹5, inclusive of input and labor costs.
Step 5: Proposal Submission and Consolidation
The Extension Officer submits a proposal containing details of the number of seedlings to be raised and the associated expenditure to the Deputy Director (E). The Deputy Director consolidates the requirements for his region and submits them to the Joint Director (E) in Guwahati, along with recommendations.
