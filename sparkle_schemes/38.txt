Details
The scheme “Scholarship for Transgender Students” was launched by the Social Justice Department, Government of Kerala for providing scholarships to Transgender students from 7th standard onwards studying in State Government/ Government aided/ Self Financing schools.
       The Transgender community faces many problems such as fear, shame, social discrimination, depression, suicidal tendencies, and social stigma. They are unable to live a dignified life, once their gender status is revealed. Steps must be taken to create public awareness so that Transgender feel that they are a part of society and are not treated as untouchables. As an effort to bring marginalized Transgender communities to the mainstream of society, Social Justice Department has initiated this scheme.
