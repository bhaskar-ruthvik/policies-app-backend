Details
The scheme “Mission Solar Charkha” a pilot project was implemented by the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Government of India. The scheme envisages setting up of Solar Charkha Clusters which would mean a focal village and other surrounding villages in a radius of 8 to 10 Kilometres. Further, such a cluster will have 200 to 2042 beneficiaries (spinners, weavers, stitches, and other skilled artisans). Each spinner will be given two charkhas of 10 spindles each. On average, it is considered that such a cluster will have about 1000 charkhas. A cluster with full capacity will provide direct employment to 2042 artisans.
         The Government of India has accorded approval to set up 50 such clusters with a budget of 550 Crores for 2018-19 and 2019-20. The Scheme is envisaged to generate direct employment of nearly one lakh persons in the approved Fifty (50) Clusters.
Objectives:
To ensure inclusive growth by the generation of employment, especially for women and youth, and sustainable development through solar charkha clusters in rural areas.

(This is to inform that as per MSME directions, further Mission Solar Charkha will only be undertaken after the outcome of the Pilot projects is assessed (9 in number) and till such time no fresh proposals will be entertained.)
