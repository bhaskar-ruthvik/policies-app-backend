Details
The Sabooj Sathi Scheme is a student welfare initiative launched by the government of West Bengal, India, to provide bicycles to students in the state. The scheme aims to promote education and empower students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, by providing them with a means of transportation to and from school.

Under the scheme, bicycles are distributed free of cost to students studying in government and government-aided schools from classes IX to XII. The scheme is implemented by the Department of School Education, West Bengal, in collaboration with the Department of Panchayats and Rural Development.

Hon’ble Finance Minister, in his Budget Speech of 2015-2016, announced a scheme for the distribution of bicycles to an estimated 40 lakh students studying in classes IX to XII in Government, Government Aided Schools, and Madrasahs of the State. He announced that around 25 lakh students would be covered in 2015-16 and the remaining 15 lahks in the next fiscal.

By now, this scheme is well-known as “Sabooj Sathi” as coined by Hon’ble Chief Minister herself and it reflects her desire to see young students empowered to achieve new feats in the future through the bicycles provided under the scheme. She also created the scheme logo which is firmly attached in the basket in front of the bicycle. Hon’ble CM flagged off the distribution in October 2015 from Paschim Medinipur.

The scheme has been successful in achieving its objectives, with over 80 lakh bicycles distributed to students across the state since its inception in 2015. The scheme has also received recognition from various national and international organizations for its impact on education and sustainable development.

The scheme was conceived with the primary objective of enhancing student access to Secondary Education. The scheme is further expected-

To increase retention in schools,
To encourage students to take up higher studies,
To inculcate sense of confidence among the girl students by promoting mobility,
To promote environment-friendly and healthy means of transportation.
The objectives are aligned with four Sustainable Goals of agenda 2030. These are SDG3: Good Health & Well-being, SDG4: Quality Education, SDG5: Gender Equality and SDG13: Climate actions.

The scheme has several objectives, including:

Enhancing the attendance and retention of students in schools, especially among girls, who often face transportation-related challenges.
Encouraging students to pursue their education beyond the primary level and complete their higher studies.
Promoting social inclusion and reducing drop-out rates among disadvantaged students.
Supporting the government's efforts towards sustainable development by reducing the carbon footprint through the use of bicycles as a means of transportation.
