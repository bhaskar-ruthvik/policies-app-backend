Details
The National Action Plan for Skill Development of Persons with Disabilities (NAP-SDP) is a dedicated skill development program aimed at providing high-quality vocational training with a focus on Persons with Disabilities (PwDs). Launched in March 2015 by the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, this Central Sector Scheme operates as part of the Umbrella Scheme SIPDA (Scheme for Implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act). The primary objectives of this scheme are:
To enhance the skills of Persons with Disabilities by providing quality vocational skill training, enabling them to gain meaningful employment.
To empower PwDs to become self-reliant, productive, and contributing members of society.

Benefits
Vocational/skill training (both short-term and long-term) is provided through a network of skill training partners. These partners include the government, the public sector, training institutions such as VRCs, private training institutions, and non-governmental organizations.
A cluster delivers partners' training nationwide, known for its successful track record in providing skill training with high employability rates.
A dedicated cross-cutting Sector Skill Council for PwDs (SCPwD) has been established under the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) in collaboration with the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and the private sector.
Additionally, mentorship projects to promote self-employment among PwDs are developed by DEPwD in collaboration with industrial confederations, sector-wise associations, domain experts, and other relevant organizations. These mentorship opportunities are tailored to address disability-specific needs.
