INTRODUCTION 
Sports are not an only institutional competitive activity but also help in educating the youths regarding their behavior and their qualities to help in their social and emotional adjustment with the society at large irrespective of culture, religion, or beliefs. It is not only a method of recreational growth and development but also helps in the integration of youth with the country’s social order.

To bring laurels to the country and for personal and professional development in sports, the youth have to not only spend their time but also their limited resources to excel. It would be imperative that the country as a whole supports its efforts financially so that resources are not a constraint to their education and sports development.

2.   To motivate the sports persons to achieve higher levels of performance by assisting them financially in relation to education and sports development. 
The scheme would be applicable to sportspersons who are medal winners in national games or
