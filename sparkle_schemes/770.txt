Details
The "SERB Science and Technology Award for Research (SERB-STAR)” is a prestigious award instituted by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) to recognize and reward the outstanding performance of Principal Investigators (PIs) of SERB Projects. SERB has been supporting basic research in frontier areas of science and engineering through its various programs and schemes. The number of researchers under the ambit of SERB has increased over the years and they contribute significantly towards the progress of science and engineering in the country through their research endeavour. SERB-STAR is an initiative to acknowledge such exemplary contributions in research and also to motivate the PIs of ongoing projects for outstanding performance.
Scientific Social Responsibility:
SERB has adopted the Scientific Social Responsibility (SSR) Policy to imbibe a culture of social commitment among SERB Grantees. The policy intends to effectively utilize the scientific infrastructure and expertise of SERB grantees to benefit other S&T stakeholders, especially the less-endowed researchers and society. SERB Grantees need to undertake some SSR activities during their project period. SSR activities need to be chosen during the submission process. Depending on the activities chosen additional budget would be provided under a separate head to carry out the chosen activities.
