Details
The scheme “Jeevanam Self-Employment Scheme to Dependents of Crime Victims” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. As part of strengthening the victim support services in the State, the Government of Kerala has started this scheme which provides financial aid to dependents as well as victims of crime. The assistance would benefit those who were struggling to make a living, including dependents of the victims of the crime and those with serious injuries. 
      When a crime is committed it can have significant, yet varying consequences, on the individual who became the victim of the crime and his family. The devastating impact of crime results in emotional, psychological, and physical as well as financial consequences. If the head of the family is killed or injured in a crime, the family is left without the main breadwinner. Killing or seriously injuring the earning member of the household as a result of the crime will deprive a family of their livelihood.
