Details
The Dalit Bandhu Scheme is a unique initiative launched by the government of Telangana to promote the economic development of families belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) community. The scheme provides financial assistance of Rs. 10 lakhs to eligible SC families to start their own businesses or entrepreneurial ventures, thereby creating opportunities for them to become self-reliant and improve their standard of living.

As a part of a multi-pronged approach, in addition to existing entitlements like food security, education, and social security, a different strategy with a new initiative "Telangana Dalit Bandhu" is introduced to intensify the level of financial assistance to SC households for the establishment of suitable income generating economic support schemes as the delivery of credit by banks in the form of loans has become a constraint.
