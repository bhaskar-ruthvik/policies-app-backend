Details
The objective of the "National Renewable Energy Fellowship Scheme" Component of the Human Resource Development Programme in New and Renewable Energy, Human Resources Development Division, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, is to institutionalize renewable energy education and training to meet the requirement of qualified and trained manpower in the country. The HRD Programme has been with a total financial outlay of Rs. 200 crore for the period of FY 2021-22 to 2025-26.

The "National Renewable Energy Fellowship Scheme" comes under the "Fellowships for Higher Studies and Research in Renewable Energy" Component of the Programme. Through this scheme, fellowships will be provided for pursuing higher studies/ advanced research in renewable energy. The fellowship scheme is directly aligned with the overall requirement of renewable energy, research thrust areas identified by MNRE, identification of technology readiness levels and focus on commercialization. The technology areas will not be of a generic nature but should involve frontier-edge research in technology development with a focused approach.
