Details

Haritha Haram is a flagship programme of the Government of Telangana, India, aimed at increasing the green cover in the state. The name Haritha Haram means "green garland" in Telugu, the official language of Telangana.

The main objective of the Haritha Haram programme is to increase the green cover of the state from the existing 24% to 33% by planting and nurturing millions of saplings every year. The programme also aims to create awareness among the public about the importance of preserving and protecting the environment.

The program was launched by Telangana Chief Minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao on 3 July 2015. It is one of the Telangana Flagship programmes to rejuvenate degraded forests, protecting these forests from threats such as smuggling, encroachment, fire and grazing. It adopted intensive soil and moisture conservation measures based on a watershed approach.

In the areas outside the existing forest, massive planting activities were to be taken up in areas such as; road-side avenues, river and canal banks, barren hills and foreshore areas, institutional premises, religious places, housing colonies, community lands, municipalities and industrial parks.

Specific duties and responsibilities are assigned to different committees to ensure the implementation of the programme in a well-designed way. These committees do regular field inspections and monitor the ongoing plantation and nursery works. The committees are the State-Level Steering Committee and the District-Level Monitoring and Coordination Committee.

At the village level, Haritha Rakshana Committees were formed to monitor the program under the Chairmanship of Gram Sarpanch.

The seedlings are monitored through geo-tagging. The Forest Department posts survival percentage details on the Department.
