Details
"Mumkin - Livelihood Generation Scheme" is an initiative launched by the Jammu & Kashmir State specifically aimed at empowering its young population. Recognizing the challenges faced by unemployed youth, this program offers financial assistance to help them embark on their journey towards self-employment. By providing subsidies and facilitating bank loans, Mumkin removes a significant financial barrier for aspiring young entrepreneurs, allowing them to invest in small commercial vehicles and establish themselves within the transportation sector. This not only fosters self-reliance among Jammu & Kashmir's youth but also injects fresh energy and resources into the local economy.
