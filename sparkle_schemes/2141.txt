Details
The Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) has established the Bank Loan Processing Fee Reimbursement Scheme. This scheme functions as a sub-component of the broader National Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Hub (NSSH) program.

The Bank Loan Processing Fee Reimbursement Scheme provides crucial financial assistance by reimbursing a substantial portion of the processing fees charged by financial institutions (FIs) when SC/ST MSEs secure business loans. This includes loans supported by both fund-based and non-fund-based limits. By alleviating the upfront financial burden of loan processing fees, the scheme aims to:
Enhance access to capital for SC/ST MSEs: By reducing the initial cost of securing a loan, the scheme encourages SC/ST entrepreneurs to pursue their business aspirations.
Promote inclusive economic development: This targeted initiative fosters the growth and success of SC/ST-owned businesses, contributing to a more equitable and diversified economy.
Strengthen entrepreneurial ecosystems: By simplifying the loan application process for SC/ST MSEs, the scheme fosters a more supportive environment for their entrepreneurial endeavors
