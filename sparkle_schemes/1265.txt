Details
he Government of Tripura has introduced a scheme called Asanghatita Sramik Sahayika Prakalpa (ASSP) to provide support to unorganized workers in the state. This scheme has been in operation since 2003 and has enrolled 1,09,534 workers from 19 unorganized sectors and 17 self-employment occupations until September 2019. The scheme is aimed at helping wage-employed and self-employed workers between the ages of 21 and 60 years who work in unorganized sectors and have an average family income of not more than Rs. 10,000 per month.

Under the ASSP scheme, each subscriber (worker) is required to contribute a sum of Rs. 50/- per month, and the State Government also contributes an equal matching amount of Rs. 50/- per month. The State Government/Bank pays interest on the balance at credit of a subscriber annually at the rate declared by the Government.

The total contribution, along with interest as declared from time to time, will be refunded to the workers on attaining the age of 60 years, or in the event of the account becoming inoperative due to death or permanent total disability due to accident or loss of two eyes or two limbs or loss of one eye or one limb in an accident or prolonged default in making contributions. 

In summary, the ASSP scheme provides a financial safety net for unorganized workers in Tripura. Eligible workers can enroll by paying a monthly contribution of Rs. 50, which is matched by the State Government. The contributions earn interest, and the total amount, including interest, is refunded to the workers when they reach the age of 60 years, or in the event of the account becoming inoperative due to certain circumstances. 

Benefits
Financial security: The scheme provides financial security for unorganized workers in Tripura, who may not have access to other financial safety nets.
Low contribution amount: The monthly contribution of Rs. 50 is a nominal amount that is affordable for most workers in unorganized sectors.
Matching contributions from the government: The State Government matches the contribution made by the worker, doubling the benefit amount.
Interest on contributions: The contributions made by the workers earn interest, further increasing the amount that they will receive on maturity.
Age-based maturity: The scheme provides a maturity benefit to workers when they reach the age of 60 years, providing a retirement benefit for workers.
Disability and death benefit: In the event of permanent total disability or death due to an accident, the account holder or their nominee will receive the maturity benefit, providing a safety net for the worker's family.
Easy enrollment process: The enrollment process for the scheme is straightforward, making it accessible to a large number of workers.
Incentivizes timely contributions: The scheme incentivizes timely contributions by providing a lock-in period of three years and returning the contributions to workers who default for prolonged periods, encouraging them to make regular contributions to the scheme.
