Details
“Students Innovations for Translation & Advancement of Research Explorations (SITARE)” Scheme is started by the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) for supporting innovative student projects in the area of biotechnology. The scheme’s mandate is to promote and encourage young students for embracing translational research to develop innovative products and technologies addressing unmet needs. The scheme has two components: SITARE-Gandhian Young Technological Innovation Award Grant (SITARE-GYTI) and SITARE-Appreciation Grant. 
SITARE-Gandhian Young Technological Innovation Award Grant (SITARE-GYTI): 
Under the SITARE-GYTI scheme component, 15 innovative student projects will receive funding support of up to INR 15 lakhs each. The scheme encourages postgraduate and doctoral students to undertake projects with commercial potential leading to the creation of biotech startups. The fund recipients are recognized as BIRAC’s SITARE-GYTI beneficiaries. “SITARE-GYTI” Award Grant is not a usual research fellowship.
Nature of Proposals supported:
Translational research proposals to develop innovative products and technologies with the potential to address unmet needs.
The work supported through the SITARE-GYTI Award Grant is expected to lead to the creation of biotech startups. Hence, only proposals with the potential to commercialize innovative products and technologies will be considered for support.
Areas covered:
SITARE-GYTI award grant proposals can be submitted in any domain including Healthcare, Lifesciences, Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Drugs, Vaccines, Drug Formulations and delivery systems, Industrial Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Agriculture, Secondary agriculture, Waste Management, Sanitation, Clean Energy and Artificial Intelligence/IoT with application in any of these areas.
BIRAC encourages interdisciplinary proposals from any stream that can help the conversion of innovative ideas into biotech products and technologies in any of the above fields.
Duration of project:
The funding is provided for a period of up to 24 months. The project is implemented in a milestone-based manner.
In case the grant award duration extends beyond the degree programme, the grantee is encouraged to incubate in any of the bio incubators for completing the SITARE-GYTI award grant mandate.
Extension:
Extension of grant award duration is discouraged. Request for extension of milestone/project can be considered (without any additional financial implications) only in selected cases based on the recommendation of the SITARE-GYTI Review Committee conducted by SITARE Partner/BIRAC. However, such a request with proper justification must reach SITARE Partner/BIRAC well before the scheduled date of completion of the grant award period.
