Details
The scheme “Scheme for Interest Subvention to Nano Household Enterprises” has been introduced to promote the Nano and household enterprises in the state. The scheme intends to provide financial assistance in the form of interest subvention to Nano and household enterprises on a reimbursement basis for the term loan availed by the unit. The units engaged in manufacturing, services as well and job work can apply under the scheme.
Objectives:
To generate employment opportunities in households through new self-employment projects (Nano/Household units)
To aggregate household/Nano units 85 increase the extent of potential employment.
To provide continuous and sustainable employment and increase the wage earning capacity of unorganized /household/units.
To address specific issues not covered under similar schemes of the Government of India/Government of Kerala.
The new scheme for providing financial assistance to Nano and household units is to support units with a capital investment of ₹10 Lakhs or less for manufacturing units engaged in job work and units engaged in service sector activities having any type of value addition in physical form by using machinery or equipment. The assistance is by way of interest subvention on the term loan availed for a period of three years on a reimbursement basis.
The assistance is provided for the first three years after the units are set up. In the first year assistance is given without considering prompt repayment. During the 2nd and 3rd year interest subvention is accorded if the loan is not classified by the bank as NPA. Thus it is a big relief in the early stages of business.
The unit will be monitored for financial health and symptoms of sickness can be found out well on time.
The units engaged in job work were hitherto not eligible for any sort of financial assistance other than under PMEGP.
