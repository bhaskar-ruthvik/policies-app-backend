Details
The Scheme “High Risk - High Reward Research” is implemented by the Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India with the aim to support proposals that are conceptually new and risky, and if successful, expected to have a paradigm-shifting influence on the S&T. This may be in terms of formulating a new hypothesis, or scientific breakthroughs which aid in emergence of new technologies. 
Nature of Proposals to be Supported:
The scheme is aimed at supporting proposals that are new, challenge existing hypothesis, and provide 'out of box' thinking on important problems. It should contain significant risk elements but promise of high reward if the difficulties could be circumvented. It is expected that the success of such proposals will have far-reaching implications in S&T. Outcome could be new and significant theoretical or experimental advances, formulation of new hypothesis, or breakthrough science which will lead to new technologies. Proposals that address scientific issues which will result in 'incremental' knowledge will not be supported. Ideally, the proposal must contain bold research ideas which will have wide-ranging impact and potential for new scientific and technological innovations.
Duration of Support:
The funding is provided normally for a period of three years. In exceptional cases, the duration can be up to 5 years as assessed by the expert committee.

Benefits
1. No budget limit is prescribed for this type of project.
2. The research grant covers equipment, consumables, contingency and travel apart from overhead grants.
