The Mukhyamantri Vishesh Yogyajan Samman Pension Yojana (MVSYS) stands as a testament to the commitment of the Government of Rajasthan towards the welfare of its citizens, particularly those with disabilities.

It operates as a lifeline for individuals grappling with various disabilities, ensuring their financial security and enabling them to lead dignified lives.
