Details
Launched by the Department of Women Empowerment and Child Development in Uttarakhand, the "Mukhyamantri Mahalaxmi Kit Yojana" is a social security scheme offering a helping hand to new mothers and their daughters.  This initiative specifically targets mothers with a family income below a certain limit. By providing essential nutritional kits, the program aims to improve the health and well-being of both mothers and their newborn daughters during the crucial postpartum period.  These kits aren't just filled with good food; they also contain necessary items to ensure proper care for both the mother and child.  Ultimately, the Mukhyamantri Mahalaxmi Kit Yojana aspires to not only support the health of mothers and daughters but also potentially bridge the nutritional gap and promote gender equality.
